### Operational Stress
* Operational stress refers to the stress we face due to the responsibilities, condition, environment, or other pressures of the workplace.
* When we are aware of such stressors and their impact, we are better prepared to manage our stress reactions and support our team members. We will also be able to perform better in our job and find meaning in our work.

### Sources of Stress
* Here are some sources of operational stress:![](/images/Ops%20Stress.jpg)*Note: This list is not exhaustive. For more information on highly stressful incidents such as critical incidents, check out the page on [critical incident stress](/content/critical-incident-stress).*

* These reactions are **normal** responses to the nature of our duties as emergency responders or supporting the organisation. However, if these reactions persist *beyond 1 month*, you should see a mental health professional to address what you are going through. There are SCDF and external resources available to support you. If you need to talk to someone immediately, you can call SCDF's 24/7 Counselling Helpline to talk to an EBSC staff.
