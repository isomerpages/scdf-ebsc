When we are carrying out our duties as emergency responders or in supporting the organisation, we may face difficult situations. Building our mental fitness helps us to deal with such difficult situations in a positive manner and bounce back from challenges!

### Challenge Unhelpful Thoughts
The first step in breaking the cycle of negativity is to recognise when such automatic and unhelpful thoughts come to mind. For many, this usually happens when we are **faced with challenges** or **overwhelmed with stress** (i.e., distress).
* To find out more on the different types of stress - eustress (positive stress which creates pleasant effects such as growth) and distress (negative stress which creates unpleasant effects such as fear and anxiety) - check out the page on [operational stress](/managing-operational-stress/ops-stress).

Once you are aware of these thoughts and able to identify them, you can challenge your thoughts and replace them with more positive and realistic ones. Try using the following steps (**P-S-D**) to challenge any unhelpful thoughts!

### Positive Reframing
When you are faced with challenges which may seem quite daunting at times, it also helps to be able to look at them in a more positive light, so that you do not feel overwhelmed. 

In psychology, there is something called the **90-10 rule** which says that the way you react to events is much more influential than the events themselves - only 10% of your life is determined by what happens to you, the other 90% is related to how you react to the 10%.

Keeping this rule in mind can help you remember that you control the majority of your life! Here are some ways you can apply the 90-10 rule:

### Tapping on Past Successes
Lastly, in times of stress, you may be overwhelmed by negative emotions. Remembering how you have successfully conquered past obstacles can motivate you. This reminds you of your strengths and makes you realise that you are more capable than you originally believe.
