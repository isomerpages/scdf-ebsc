### Identifying Distressed Colleagues
From time to time, we may encounter stressful challenges during our course of work. While some stress can motivate us to achieve our goals, too much stress (i.e., distress) can be overwhelming and hinder daily functioning.

There are 4 general types of distress: **B**ehavioural, **E**motional, **E**fficiency at work, and **P**hysical (the acronym of **B-E-E-P**) and it is important that we recognise the warning signs of distress and respond with appropriate support.

What are some signs that our colleagues are in distress?

*Note: This is a non-exhaustive list, and different individuals may exhibit different symptoms. These reactions are also normal responses to the nature of our duties as emergency responders or supporting the organisation.*

### Helping Our Colleagues
Following the identification of distressed colleagues, you are strongly encouraged to engage them to gain a better understanding of their concerns and render appropriate assistance.

Here are 5 steps to help your colleagues: **A**ttending, **L**istening, **E**ffective Questioning, **R**eferral, and **T**imely Intervention (**A-L-E-R-T**)

### Referral and Counselling
If you feel that your colleague's signs and symptoms of distress are not going away, or if you have any other concerns, counselling is an option to consider. 

For more information on SCDF's counselling processes, you can approach your supervisor, or contact SCDF_CARE@scdf.gov.sg or 6848 3433.

### Support Options
It is **normal** to feel that seeking support can be viewed by others as being 'weak' or not up to the expectations of an emergency responder. However, you and your colleagues need to take care of yourselves before you can take care of others as an emergency responder or in supporting the organisation.

In addition to SCDF's counselling support, there are various in-house and external resources that are available for you to refer your colleagues to. Click [here](/support-options/) for an overview of the support options available.
