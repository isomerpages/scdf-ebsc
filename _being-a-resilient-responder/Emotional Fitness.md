When you are feeling overwhelmed, the following strategies can help you regulate your emotions and calm yourself down. Practising these strategies **in between your shifts at your station** or **at home** lets you gain familiarity with them, so that the tips and tricks can readily come to your mind when you need them!

### Shift Your Focus of Attention
The first technique is to shift your focus of attention away from the emotions you are experiencing â€“ physically, or mentally. This gives yourself some time and space to slow down first, and think through the situation more carefully later on.

### Deep Breathing
Another technique is deep breathing, which can help you quickly control your emotional responses when you feel overwhelmed by giving you time to calm down and relook at the situation. 

Box breathing involves 4 steps, each lasting for 4 seconds:
* #1: Breathe in 
* #2: Hold your breath 
* #3: Breathe out 
* #4: Hold your breath

**Try it out by following this video!** What's great about this strategy is that you can do it *whenever* you need it and *wherever* you are at - whether you are at home or at the station!

### Progressive Muscle Relaxation
Another technique is progressive muscle relaxation, starting from your head to your toes. Try out a PMR audio exercise [here](https://www.healthhub.sg/sites/assets/Assets/Programs/mindsg/audio/Progressive_Muscle_Relaxation.mp3)!

You can engage in PMR while seated:

Alternatively, you can engage in PMR while lying down. Try doing this when resting on your back, the steps are the same:

### Visualisation
The last technique is visualisation. Similar to daydreaming, visualisation is accomplished through using your imagination. You can close your eyes and listen to a visualisation audio exercise [here](https://www.healthhub.sg/sites/assets/Assets/Programs/mindsg/audio/Guided_Imagery.mp3).
