When you are feeling overwhelmed, the following strategies can help you to regulate your emotions and calm yourself down. Practising these strategies **in between your shifts at your station** or **at home** lets you gain familiarity with them, so that the tips and tricks can readily come to your mind when you need them!

### Shift Your Focus of Attention
The first technique is to shift your focus of attention away from the emotions you are experiencing â€“ physically, or mentally. This gives yourself some time and space to slow down first, and think through the situation more carefully later on.

### Deep Breathing
Another technique is deep breathing, which can help you quicklycontrol your emotional responses when you feel overwhelmed by giving you time to calm down and relook at the situation.
