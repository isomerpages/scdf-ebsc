When you are feeling overwhelmed, the following strategies can help you to regulate your emotions and calm yourself down. Practising these strategies **in between your shifts at your station** or **at home** lets you gain familiarity with them, so that the tips and tricks can readily come to your mind when you need them!

### Shift Your Focus of Attention
The first technique is to shift your focus of attention away from the emotions you are experiencing â€“ physically, or mentally. This gives yourself some time and space to slow down first, and think through the situation more carefully later on.
