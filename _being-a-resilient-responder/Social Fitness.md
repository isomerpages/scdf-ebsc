Human beings are social creatures, and part of our well-being lies in belonging in groups and feeling connected to the people around us. We feel happier when we have good relationships with our family, peers, and supervisors. Having a strong social support system also helps us to cope better with the demands of our work as first responders, so that we are **more resilient** and can **confidently face challenges**.

### Social Awareness
Social awareness refers to your ability to accurately sense others' needs and understand their perspectives. Increasing your social awareness enables you to communicate and collaborate more effectively with others. While it is important to manage your relationships with your team members so that you can work well together, it is also important to manage your relationships with your family at home!

Here are some ways you can build your social awareness - both at work as you interact with your team, and at home in your interactions with your family members:

### Managing Relationships
In your units/divisions, you will have to work with others in teams. When your team works well together, you will be able to overcome obstacles and achieve shared goals. Ensure that teamwork is a successful and smooth-sailing experience by putting in place effective group processes and maintaining good relationships. ![](/images/social%20support%203.png)

### Your Support System
Lastly, having a strong social support system is important to having a good quality of life. Having someone you can trust and open up to is a gift. Just talking to them can be very helpful! You can seek support from your family, friends, supervisors, and fellow peers going through the same experience as you.

Having a strong social support system requires some effort, such as by showing those you care about that you have time for them and are interested in their lives. Take time to invest in your existing relationships and grow your support!
