Human beings are social creatures, and part of our well-being lies in belonging in groups and feeling connected to the people around us. We feel happier when we have good relationships with our family, peers, and supervisors. Having a strong social support system also helps us to cope better with the demands of our work as first responders, so that we are **more resilient** and can **confidently face challenges**.

Social Awareness
Social awareness refers to your ability to accurately sense others' needs and understand their perspectives. Increasing your social awareness enables you to communicate and collaborate more effectively with others.
