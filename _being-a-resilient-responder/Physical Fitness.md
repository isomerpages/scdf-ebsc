### Healthy Eating
Lastly, remember to eat healthily! Having a healthy diet is easier than you think. All you have to do is "Quarter, Quarter, Half" your plate - 1/4 plate of wholegrains or wholemeal foods, 1/4 plate of protein such as lean cuts of meat, poultry, fish, seafood, eggs, and dairy products, as well as plant-based protein such as toufu, nuts, beans, and legumes. The remaining 1/2 plate should be for different types of fruits and vegetables.
