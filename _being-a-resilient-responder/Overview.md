Part of being a resilient responder involves being psychologically prepared and coping proactively with the stressors we face at work. With the nature of our work as an emergency responder, we may feel overwhelmed by our experiences at work and "fall", but that is alright as long as we find our way to stand back up - this is the definition of **resilience**, being able to adapt and bounce back in the face of challenging circumstances! Additionally, by developing and enhancing our Fitness 4 (Physical, Mental, Emotional, and Social Fitness) levels, we can achieve a balanced and all-rounded readiness to deal with the daily challenges and operational needs of our roles in SCDF. 

As the trick lies in steadfastness and not complacency, we can practise these strategies in between our shifts - even before we experience any signs and symptoms of operational stress. While these strategies are helpful in post-ops recovery, they are also helpful when practised consistently pre-ops so that we will be **operationally ready** and ultimately **reduce any unnecessary operational stress** we may experience!
