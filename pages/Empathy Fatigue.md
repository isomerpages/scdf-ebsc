### What is Empathy Fatigue?
Empathy fatigue refers to an **emotional exhaustion** that manifests as the reduced ability of an emergency responder to be empathetic towards the survivor they are working with.

### Signs and Symptoms
While many firefighters and paramedics are good at internalising operational stress while functioning well from the perspective of others, empathy fatigue can be a real possibility for some without any effective coping mechanisms and strong personal boundaries put in place. 

Do you recognise any of these **signs and symptoms of empathy fatigue** in yourself or your colleagues?

Many firefighters and paramedics will likely experience one or more symptoms of empathy fatigue at some point in their careers. However, these symptoms become a problem when they begin to **interfere with an individual's ability to function**. 

How impaired daily functioning can look like differs across individuals, but generally adds up to being **unable to meet the minimum responsibilities of work, home, or self-care**. Here are some examples: ![](/images/empathy%20fatigue%203.png)
In our eagerness to help others, we sometimes forget that to be able to do so, we have to take care of ourselves first. One way to **take care of yourself** is to set boundaries, so that you can function well at work and enjoy time away from work. Other ways of self-care include taking up a hobby, listening to music, walking in nature, or spending more time with loved ones.

Taking care of yourself also includes building your [physical fitness](/being-a-resilient-responder/physical-fitness), [mental fitness](/being-a-resilient-responder/mental-fitness), [emotional fitness](/being-a-resilient-responder/emotional-fitness), and [social fitness](/being-a-resilient-responder/social-fitness), which you can start doing today!

*Note: While the terms 'compassion' and 'empathy' are often used interchangeably, recent research has found that the term 'empathy fatigue' is more appropriate, compared to using the term 'compassion fatigue'.*
