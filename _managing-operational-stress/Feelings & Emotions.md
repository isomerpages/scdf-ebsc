Our emotions play a role in guiding the decisions we make. The world around us triggers emotional reactions, and a lot of what we do is motivated by a desire to change or maintain a feeling-state - to hold on to good feelings or avoid bad feelings.

It is thus helpful to know how we are feeling and what actions our emotions may be guiding us towards. Let's start with exploring how you are feeling today!

### How Are You Feeling Today?
You can feel more than one emotion at any one time. For example, when you think that you have completed a task well, you may feel confident in your work and happy.

Similarly, good and "bad" emotions can co-exist. You do not have to only feel positive emotions or negative emotions in the present moment - you may feel relieved about a certain situation, but also feel disappoint that the outcome was not up to your expectations.

So, how are you feeling today? These are some examples of words that can help you to describe how you are currently feeling:

### Emotion's Frequency and Intensity
In addition to knowing the emotion (or emotions) you are feeling, you can also look at **how much** of the emotion you are feeling and **how often** you may feel this way.

### How Our Emotions May Motivate Us
The emotions that you feel can also play a role in influencing what you are motivated to do, for example:

### Impact of Our Emotions
Since your emotions can influence what you are motivated to do, if you want to manage your emotions, you first need to be aware of how they may impact your life.
