### Perception of Events
Our thoughts can shape our actions.

For example:

It is not the event that bothers us. Instead, it is the way we **interpret** the event - the **meaning** we give to the event - that results in our feelings. This explains why two people experiencing the same event can react in completely different ways. 

This also means that although we may not always be able to change the situations we find ourselves in or the people we meet, we are in charge of how we interpret events. Our attitudes and perspectives determine how we will feel.

### Automatic Thoughts
Since our **thoughts** determine how we will **feel**, which in turn shapes our **actions**, it is important to know what type of thoughts we may have.

We may have automatic thoughts that just 'pop' into our minds. While these thoughts are often very believable, they can be biased. Given that these thought patterns were learned and influenced by our values over a long period of time, they can be difficult to change.

However, what we can do when an automatic thought 'pops' into our mind is to **recognise** whether the thought is helpful or unhelpful. 

### Examples of Unhelpful Thoughts
After attending to a challenging or routine call, when doing your work supporting the organisation, or even in your personal life, there may be some automatic thoughts that 'pop' into your mind. These thoughts can fall under the category of **unhelpful thinking styles**, which include the following:

### Helpful Thoughts

By reframing such thoughts into more helpful thoughts, you can break free from negative patterns of behaviours. Try out these [tools](/being-a-resilient-responder/mental-fitness) to challenge unhelpful thoughts and build your mental fitness!
