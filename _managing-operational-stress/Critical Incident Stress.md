### Critical Incidents
A critical incident is any event that causes **unusually strong emotional reactions** that have the potential to **interfere with the ability to function normally** (International Critical Incident Stress Foundation, 2015).

Examples of critical incidents:
* Significant events involving children
* Suicide of a colleague
* Line-of-duty deaths/injuries
* Threats to personal safety
* Multiple casualties
* Disaster/large-scale operations
* Attending to relatives/friends
* Gruesome incidents
* Extensive media coverage
* Workplace harassment
