### What is Compartmentalisation?
Compartmentalisation refers to a defense mechanism where we **mentally separate** any conflicting thoughts, emotions, or events to avoid the discomfort of contradiction. 

When we are handling a few problems simultaneously, it can be challenging to stay focused to complete the necessary tasks. Putting a problem on hold by compartmentalising and focusing on the task at hand can help us to take action.
