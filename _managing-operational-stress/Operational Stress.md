### Stress
There are different types of stress. While many of us may associate stress with something negative, stress is **not** always a bad thing. Stress can be good, and we need a good amount of stress to grow. This form of stress is called eustress.

### What is Eustress?
Eustress is the opposite of distress in terms of how you experience it. It is when stress **creates pleasant effects** and is often called **positive stress**.

### What is Distress?
On the other hand, distress **causes unpleasant effects** such as worry and anxiety. It is often called **negative stress** because of how it may affect us.

For more signs and symptoms of distress, you can check out the **BEEP model** under stress-related reactions below.

While too much stress can be overwhelming (i.e., distress), we can still learn to **manage** this stress that we experience using appropriate strategies, such as the strategies found under [physical](/being-a-resilient-responder/physical-fitness), [mental](/being-a-resilient-responder/mental-fitness), [emotional](/being-a-resilient-responder/emotional-fitness), and [social](/being-a-resilient-responder/social-fitness) fitness!

### Operational Stress
How is the topic of stress relevant to emergency responders? A common form of stress we may experience in our work context is **operational stress** - which refers to the stress we face due to the responsibilities, condition, environment, or other pressures of the workplace.

When we are aware of such stressors and their impact, we are better prepared to manage our stress reactions and support our team members. We will also be able to perform better in our job and find meaning in our work.

### Stress-Related Reactions
What are some common signs that we may be experiencing distress? Let's use the **BEEP** model to help us understand our stressors better!

These reactions are **normal** responses to the nature of our duties as emergency responders or supporting the organisation. However, if these reactions persist **beyond 1 month**, you should see a mental health professional to address what you are going through. There are [SCDF](/support-options/SCDF-resources) and [external](/support-options/external-resources) resources available to support you. If you need to talk to someone immediately, you can call SCDF's 24/7 Counselling Helpline (1800-286-6666) to talk to an EBSC staff.

You can also check out these pages on building your [physical](/being-a-resilient-responder/physical-fitness), [mental](/being-a-resilient-responder/mental-fitness), [emotional](/being-a-resilient-responder/emotional-fitness), and [social](/being-a-resilient-responder/social-fitness) fitness that can help you in dealing with your daily challenges and coping with the stress faced at work.
