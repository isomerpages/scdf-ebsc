We can learn to cope proactively with the stressors we face at work. Coping strategies are mental efforts or behaviours that we adopt to deal with a stressful event.

As the trick lies in consistency, not complacency, we can practice these strategies in between our shifts â€“ even before we experience the signs and symptoms of operational stress. While these strategies are helpful in post-ops recovery, they are most helpful when practiced consistently pre-ops so that we will be **operationally ready**!

By developing and enhancing our Fitness 4 (Physical, Mental, Emotional and Social Fitness) levels, we can achieve a balanced and all-rounded readiness to deal with the daily challenges and operational needs of our roles in SCDF, and ultimately **reduce the trauma and operational stress we experience**.
