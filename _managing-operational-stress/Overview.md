With the nature of our work as emergency responders, we may experience operational stress. This can potentially impact different areas of our lives, such as our thoughts, feelings, and behaviours. This can also alter our general outlook on life and also our interactions with others, including family, friends, and work colleagues.

Thus, it is important for us to first **be aware** of possible stressors and their impacts, so that we can learn some strategies to **manage the stressors** and **take care of our well-being** while continuing to fulfil our roles as emergency responders in saving lives and property!
